imolecule
=========

An embeddable webGL molecule viewer and file format converter.
http://patrickfuller.github.io/imolecule/

Examples
========

 * [file format converter](http://50.240.131.209:9000/)
 * [metal-organic frameworks](http://patrickfuller.github.io/imolecule/examples/mof.html)

Usage
=====

```javascript
imolecule.create('my-selector');
imolecule.draw(myMolecule);
```

where `'my-selector'` is where you want to place imolecule, and `myMolecule` is
an object. See below for more on the object structure, or just check out the
included examples. The `imolecule.create()` method takes a few optional parameters,
specifying a few common drawing and camera types.

```javascript
options = {
    drawingType: "ball and stick", // Can be "ball and stick", "wireframe", or "space filling"
    cameraType: "perspective", // Can be "perspective" or "orthogonal"
    shader: THREE.ShaderToon.toon2, // three.js shader algorithm to use
    z: 15 // Initial camera distance to origin
};
```

Molecule Data Format
====================

At its core, imolecule takes input chemical structures as javascript objects.
As an example, consider benzene:

```javascript
{
    atoms: [
        { element: "C", location: [ -0.762160, 1.168557, 0.022754 ] },
        { element: "C", location: [ 0.631044, 1.242862, -0.013022 ] },
        { element: "C", location: [ 1.391783, 0.076397, -0.012244 ] },
        { element: "C", location: [ 0.762101, -1.168506, 0.026080 ] },
        { element: "C", location: [ -0.631044, -1.242903, -0.011791 ] },
        { element: "C", location: [ -1.391806, -0.076430, -0.014083 ] },
    ],
    bonds: [
        { atoms: [ 0, 1 ], order: 2 },
        { atoms: [ 1, 2 ], order: 1 },
        { atoms: [ 2, 3 ], order: 2 },
        { atoms: [ 3, 4 ], order: 1 },
        { atoms: [ 4, 5 ], order: 2 },
        { atoms: [ 0, 5 ], order: 1 }
    ]
}
```

If you want to make properly formatted JSON, you can use either `format_converter.py` as a script
or a running imolecule instance (like [this one](http://www.patrick-fuller.com/imolecule.html))
to convert most chemical file formats to JSON.

Chemical File Format Conversion
===============================

This program optionally uses [tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/) to
create and connect to a server that handles chemical file format conversion
with [Open Babel](http://openbabel.org/wiki/Main_Page).

To run in its provided state, you will need Tornado.

```
pip install tornado
```

You will also need Open Babel, which is best installed from source. For more,
read through the [Open Babel installation instructions](http://openbabel.org/docs/dev/Installation/install.html).

```
git clone https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ../openbabel -DPYTHON_BINDINGS=ON
make && make install
```

Once this is set up, run the full program with

```
python server.py
```

The default site allows for loading molecules via a simple file drag-and-drop interface.
Drag a file to anywhere in the browser and drop to load. This interface
communicates with openbabel via websocket, so most file formats should work. Be
sure to set the extensions of your files to their data type (ie. "mol", "pdb",
etc.) for format inference to work properly.

If you have an existing web server, tornado can be easily switched out for
other libraries. If you want to use imolecule as a starting point for a
broader user interface, the server is written to be extensible. In both cases,
read through the source code - it's surprisingly short.

IPython support
===============

The IPython notebook is an open-source tool poised to replace MATLAB in many
applications. As a scientist of sorts, I'm all about it. Therefore, I made
handles to use imolecule with the notebook.

Open a new notebook and make sure that the imolecule
directory is either in the directory you started the notebook or your
PYTHONPATH. You can test the setup by typing:

```python
import imolecule
imolecule.draw("CC1(C(N2C(S1)C(C2=O)NC(=O)CC3=CC=CC=C3)C(=O)O)C")
```

into a notebook cell. This should convert, optimize and draw the specified
SMILES structure (in this case, penicillin) into the notebook. Note that this
requires Open Babel to function.

The drawer can handle any format specified [here](http://openbabel.org/docs/2.3.1/FileFormats/Overview.html),
and can be set up to better handle different use cases. Check out the docstrings
associated with the IPython interface for more.
